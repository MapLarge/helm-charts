# MapLarge Helm Charts

MapLarge is a geospatial database and developer platform. It provides a central location for users of all types (developers, analysts, program monitors, etc.) to collect, compare, and analyze data and build products to help solve key intelligence questions. MapLarge is capable of coalescing geospatial data from multiple data sources into a single visual platform. The built in analytics provide automated solutions to quickly and efficiently analyze the data, reducing the amount of data an analyst is required to review.

This repository contains the custom helm chart to deploy MapLarge into a Kubernetes cluster.

Full details for the Helm Chart configuration can be found in the chart's [README](./maplarge/README.md)
